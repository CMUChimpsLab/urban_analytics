Trying to use google maps (copy from Andy) to display a map quickly and easily.
Ideally we'd be able to display one user's tweets easily.

If you get:
- ImportError: no module named flask (or something): make sure you're in the
virtualenv (source ../env/bin/activate)
- pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure: could not connect to localhost:27017: make
sure mongod is running
